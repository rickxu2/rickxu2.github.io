        <h3>RISC-V Operating System</h3>
        <p>As a part of the ECE391 Coursework, I work in a team of 3 to develop a working UNIX-like Operating System running on QEMU
            for the RISC-V architecture. The functions of the OS includes a shell, VirtIO device drivers, a virtual memory system, an user process system
            and a file system. The project is written in C and Assembly.</p>

      <!-- Another Example Project with Video -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>Robot Localization Using AprilTags and Swerve Odometry (FRC)</h3>
        <p>With a team, we build a localization system for FIRST Robotics Competitio Robot based on WPILib and PhotonVision. 
            The AprilTag detection system is runned on an RK3588 Processor and communicates with the NI RoboRIO to provide localoization data.
            The system on the NI RoboRIO fuses Odometry, which is calculated from drivetrain motor data, and the Apriltag vision system.

      <div class="project">
        <h3>6-DOF robotics Arm Programming on STM32(RoboMaster)</h3>
        <p>
            As a major developer in a team, I programmed a robot with a 6-DOF robotics arm and a Swerve drivetrain. 
            I developed an on-board(STM32) inverse kinematics algorithm for both the robotics arm and the Swerve Drivetrain.
            The objectives of the robot is to collect foam cubes using an end effector and transport them to a different location with a specific pose.
            The robot is controlled by 2 STM32 microcontrollers, 1 for the arm and another for the drive train. 
            The communication between two microcontrollers and between the motors and the controllers are through CAN bus.
            The robot is controlled by a drone controller whose data ports are modified to get inputs from a desktop arm with the same configuration built with servos.
